Project Name: Plant Leaf Disease Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Overview:

This project implements a CNN-based system to classify and detect various plant leaf diseases from images. It leverages the power of deep learning for accurate identification, potentially aiding farmers and agricultural professionals in disease management and crop protection.

Key Technologies:

TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch): Deep learning framework for building and training CNN models.
OpenCV (or Pillow): Image processing library for pre-processing image data.
NumPy, Pandas (optional): Libraries for handling numerical data and data analysis tasks.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or later) and the required libraries installed. Use pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python (or equivalent commands for PyTorch and Pillow) in your terminal.
Data Acquisition: Collect a dataset of labeled plant leaf images covering various diseases and healthy leaves. Explore public datasets or curate your own.
Data Preprocessing: Process images to a standardized format (e.g., size, normalization). Might involve resizing, cropping, and converting to grayscale if necessary.
Model Building: Define your CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch. Consider factors like input layer size, number of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions.
Model Training: Train the model on your prepared dataset, providing labeled images and their corresponding disease categories. Monitor training progress and adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) for optimal performance.
Evaluation: Once trained, evaluate the model's accuracy on a separate test dataset. Use metrics like classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
Visualization: Visualize the model's predictions using techniques like heatmaps to understand which image regions contribute to the classification results. This can aid in interpreting the model's behavior and improving its interpretability
