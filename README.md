# Flight Price Detection

This is a mini data science project that predicts flight prices based on user input. The project uses several popular Python libraries including scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Overview
The Flight Price Detection project aims to predict the price of flights using various input features provided by the user. It leverages machine learning algorithms from the scikit-learn library to build and evaluate models. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and visualization of results.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repository and install the required libraries using the following commands:
